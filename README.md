# Compose-calendar

This is a simple calendar app built using Android Compose, which allows users to select and delete dates. The app is designed with a minimalistic user interface, making it easy to use and navigate.

This is the first version (V1) of the app, which is meant to be a simple demonstration of how to build a calendar app using Android Compose. In future versions, I plan to add more features such as event scheduling,saving local storage and reminders.
